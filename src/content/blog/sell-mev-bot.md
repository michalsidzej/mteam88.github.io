Anyone trying to sell an MEV bot is a scammer (or just stupid.)

An analogy:

> A boy finds a machine laying on the ground. The machine comes with simple instructions: "press button to print money." The machine does what it says: it prints a crisp $20 bill whenever the boy presses the button. A businessman sees this from his car and offers the boy a million dollars for the machine. The boy would be foolish to accept the offer because this machine could print much more than a million dollars. The machine is priceless.

My point: **No rational person with a profit-generating MEV bot will sell their bot for any price.**

**Don't fall for scams.**

P.S. There are no exceptions.
